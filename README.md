## Overview
Granite 4.0 language models are lightweight, state-of-the-art open foundation models that natively support multilingual capabilities, a wide range of coding tasks—including fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code completion—retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool usage, and structured JSON output.

Our models are developed using a combination of advanced techniques such as structured chat formatting, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning–based model alignment, and model merging. Granite 4.0 features significantly improved *instruction-following* and *tool-calling* capabilities, making it highly effective for enterprise applications and an ideal choice for deployment in environments with constrained compute resources.

All models are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing free use for both research and commercial purposes. The data curation and training processes were specifically designed for enterprise scenarios and customization, incorporating governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) evaluations alongside IBM’s standard data clearance and document quality review procedures.

The initial release of the Granite 4.0 models included three sizes—micro, tiny, and small—built on dense, dense-hybrid, and mixture-of-experts (MoE) hybrid architectures. Additional model sizes have been added gradually. We provide both base models (checkpoints after pretraining) and instruct models (checkpoints fine-tuned for dialogue, instruction following, helpfulness, and safety).

Core evaluation results for all model variants are provided on their respective model cards, and a more comprehensive extended evaluation is available [here](URL).

<!-- Comprehensive evaluation results for all model variants, as well as other relevant information will be available in Granite 4.0 Language Models technical report. -->

## Inference Examples

### Basic Inference
This is a simple example of how to use Granite-4.0-H-Small model.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

device = "auto"
model_path = "ibm-granite/granite-4.0-h-small"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
# drop device_map if running on CPU
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device_map=device)
model.eval()
# change input text as desired
chat = [
    { "role": "user", "content": "What is the name of the durable rock known for being one of the hardest natural building stones?"},

]

chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)

# tokenize the text
input_tokens = tokenizer(chat, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
# generate output tokens
output = model.generate(**input_tokens, 
                        max_new_tokens=150)
# decode output tokens into text
output = tokenizer.batch_decode(output)
# print output
print(output)
```

### Tool-calling capabilities for AI agents
Agentic tool-calling is shaping the future of AI agents, enabling seamless integration of powerful back-end systems into agent-driven workflows. These trajectories often involve multiple tool calls, handling execution responses, and multi-turn user interactions. While agent frameworks orchestrate long-horizon tasks, LLMs must provide the foundation — including standard tool formats, robust tool-call handling (even in edge cases), and support for feeding back execution results. 

The following code example demonstrates how Granite 4.0’s tool-calling capabilities address these needs. In the first user query, the model successfully generates the appropriate tool call because it has access to the necessary tools. In contrast, it produces an apology message for the second query, as the required tooling is unavailable. Since this example does not use an agent framework, tool execution is simulated.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

device = "cuda"
# model_path = ""
model_path = "ibm-granite/granite-4.0-micro"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
# drop device_map if running on CPU
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device_map=device)
model.eval()

chat=[

    {"role": "assistant", 
        "content": "", 
        "tool_calls": [

                    "arguments": {"vin": "1FMXK92W8YPA12345"}

        "required": ["vin"]
      }
    }
  },
]
    
chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat,tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True, tools=tools)

# tokenize the text
input_tokens = tokenizer(chat, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
# generate output tokens
output = model.generate(**input_tokens, 
                        max_new_tokens=1000)
# decode output tokens into text
output = tokenizer.batch_decode(output)
# print output
print(output[0])
```

## JSON as Output
Granite natively supports structured JSON output, a capability that proves useful in many real-world scenarios. Below, we demonstrate how it can be applied to parse natural language IT support tickets.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

device = "cuda"
model_path = "ibm-granite/granite-4.0-h-tiny" 

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
# drop device_map if running on CPU
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device_map=device)
model.eval()

chat = [
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a helpful assistant that answers in JSON. Here's the json schema you must adhere to:\n<schema>\n{\"title\":\"ITSupportTicket\",\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"ticketID\":{\"type\":\"string\"},\"requester\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"name\":{\"type\":\"string\"},\"email\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"format\":\"email\"}},\"required\":[\"name\",\"email\"]},\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Access\",\"Hardware\",\"Software\",\"Network\",\"Other\"]},\"priority\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Low\",\"Medium\",\"High\",\"Critical\"]},\"description\":{\"type\":\"string\"},\"reportedAt\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"format\":\"date-time\"}},\"required\":[\"ticketID\",\"requester\",\"category\",\"priority\",\"description\",\"reportedAt\"]}\n</schema>\n"
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Please breakdown the follwing IT ticket's content and classify it for me.\n# This is the ticket:\nI can't access the VPN from home—keeps timing out after authentication. Please mark this as High priority. I'm Jordan Lee, jordan.lee@acme.co. Create the ticket as TCK-10944. I noticed the issue today around 2025-10-01T08:35:00Z."
  }
]

chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat,tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)

# tokenize the text
input_tokens = tokenizer(chat, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
# generate output tokens
output = model.generate(**input_tokens, 
                        max_new_tokens=200)
# decode output tokens into text
output = tokenizer.batch_decode(output)
# print output
print(output[0])
```

## Fill-in-the-middle (FIM) Code Completion
The FIM (Fill-in-the-Middle) code completion capability is highly valuable for software developers, as it enables models to intelligently generate missing code segments within existing functions. The example below demonstrates how it can be used to complete a function that processes user data and produces a summary.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

device = "cuda"
# model_path = ""
model_path = "ibm-granite/granite-4.0-micro"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)

# drop device_map if running on CPU
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device_map=device)
model.eval()

prompt = """<|fim_prefix|>
def summarize_users(users):
    \"\"\"
    Given a list of user dictionaries with 'name' and 'age',
    return a summary with the average age and a list of names.
    \"\"\"
    summary = {}
<|fim_suffix|>
    return summary
<|fim_middle|>
"""

chat = [
    { "role": "user", "content": prompt},
]

chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)

# tokenize the text
input_tokens = tokenizer(chat, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
# generate output tokens
output = model.generate(**input_tokens, 
                        max_new_tokens=100)
# decode output tokens into text
output = tokenizer.batch_decode(output)
# print output
print(output[0])
```
